     <pre class="about-text">        Hi there! I'm shashwat shah,

        Currently an 2nd year student pursuing B-tech in ICT
        I am emerging software developer with great interests,
        My passionate fields are web develpoment,
        competitive programming (and still exlploring..)
        
        I had just dived in the ocean of web-development where,
        I am expereincing immense pleasure by having the output 
        right in front of my eyes.
        
        Currently I am good with skills like HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        But thats just a start, I have further goals of learning ReactJS 
        and css-frameworks like Tailwind (To have more user-specific interface)
        and many more in Frontend and then towards backend.

        Also I have decent CP skills and moving all the way up

        If you are looking for a Web-developer who is impassioned about building great software
        and delivering results, I will love to connect with you.  Let's chat! <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>
